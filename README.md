#<center>HTML5-based Atari Pong-like Game</center>

## Mission:
This is an experiment on canvas object from HTML5 to build a fully functional table tennis game (Atari type).  Standard javascript.
For first time programmers.  Back to basics for me.

* Ball hits on paddle at the top and bottom results in higher angle of return and increase in speed
* Your paddle is on left. Computer has the one on the right.
* Click mouse to restart game.

## Development Methodology:
